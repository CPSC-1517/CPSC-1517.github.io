# Razor Syntax

Razor syntax allows developers to intermingle server-side code with static HTML content (HTML markup, CSS and Javascript). This makes it possible to control what HTML is sent to the client's browser and to process form data and other requests on the web server. Razor itself is not a programming language; instead, it "wraps" the server-side programming language (*Visual Basic .NET* or *C#*). In the simplest sense, Razor is just a set of symbols that tell the web server to run a snippet of code on the web server.

Normally, static HTML files have the extension *.htm* or *.html*. Razor files are simply HTML files with the extension of *.**cs**html* (for C#) or *.**vb**html* (for Visual Basic).
