# A06: Offerings

You must do three forms (A, B and C) based on the following database tables.

![](A06.png)

- **Form A** - Single Item Create/Read/Update/Delete
  - Offerings
- **Form B** - Gridview Lookup with Code-Behind
  - Offerings by Course
- **Form C** - Gridview Lookup with ObjectDataSource controls
  - Offerings by Course

**Recommended Stored Procedures** - The following specialty stored procedures are available:

`Offerings_FindByProgramCourseAndSemester` Returns zero or 1 Offerings records matching the supplied program id, course id and semester

`Offerings_FindByCourse` Returns zero or more Offerings records matching the supplied course id

`ProgramCourses_FindByProgramAndCourse` Returns zero or 1 ProgramCourse records matching the supplied program id and course id

`Courses_FindByProgram` Returns zero or more Courses belonging to the supplied program id

`Courses_FindByPartialName` Returns zero or more Courses belonging to the supplied partial course name

`Semesters_FindActiveFuture` Returns zero or more SchoolTerms records currently active or are future semseters

**Important Notes:** 

Use filtering for main lookup: ProgramID, CourseID (Courses filter by Program) and Semester

Only Offerings for current or future semesters can be updated or deleted.

This scenario lookup may be more challenging. 

FormB and FormC will use a two step filter to find the course id. Find a list of courses to select from using the partial course name.

Create a NotMapped annotation property in the ProgramCourse entity which will return a string formatted to  courseid (programid). Example BAI3990 (2).

Use the ProgramCourse notmapped annotation in FormC as the display text for a dropdownlist used in displaying the programcourseid. Ensure you properly position in the dropdownlist.
