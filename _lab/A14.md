**Recommended Stored Procedures** - The following specialty stored procedures are available:

`ClubActivities_FindByClubAndDate` Returns zero or more ClubActivities records matching the club id and is on/after the supplied date

`ClubActivities_FindByClub` Returns zero or more ClubActivities records matching the club id 

**Important Notes:** 

Use Club and a start date filter for main ClubActivities lookup: 

Only future ClubActivities can be created, updated or deleted.

ClubActivities' `StartDate` will default to Today if no start date is given when the activity is created.

ClubActivities will have a CampusVenue assigned unless it is off campus. A CampusVenues `Description` list can be obtained from the database. 

Off campus activities must be flagged and have a location.
