- **Form B** - Gridview Lookup with Code-Behind
  - StudentAddresses by Student
- **Form C** - Gridview Lookup with ObjectDataSource controls

**Recommended Stored Procedures** - The following specialty stored procedures are available:

`Students_FindByPartialName` Returns zero or more Students whos first or last name includes the supplied string

`StudentAddressess_FindByStudent` Returns zero or more StudentAddresses matching the supplied student id

`Addresses_FindByPartialStreetAddress` Returns zero or more Addresses whos Number and Street contains the supplied values.

**Important Notes:** 

Use Student Name filter for main Address lookup: 

StudentAddresses are not delete. StudentAddresses are in effect until the UntilDate has been set.

Use Address filter search for Address and ForwardingAddress.

Include a not mapped property called Fulladdress when creating the Address entity definition. This property will return a string containing the full address format number street (unit). Only add the (unit) if the unit is not null. Examples 1001 14 Ave or 12015 109 St (A215).
