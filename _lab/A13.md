`StudentAddressess_FindByStudent` Returns zero or more StudentAddresses matching the supplied student id

`Addresses_FindByPartialStreetAddress` Returns zero or more Addresses whos Number and Street contains the supplied values.

**Important Notes:** 

StudentAddresses are not delete. StudentAddresses are in effect until the UntilDate has been set.

Form B and Form C will display the FullAddress for Address and FowardingAddress.

Include a not mapped property called FullAddress when creating the Address entity definition. This property will return a string containing the full address format number street (unit). Only add the (unit) if the unit is not null. Examples 1001 14 Ave or 12015 109 St (A215).
