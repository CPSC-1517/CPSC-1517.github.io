- Explain how Razor syntax supports "context switching" in the server-side processing of a web page
- Distinguish between server-side code and HTML code in a Razor web form
- Describe what is meant by a "code block" in Razor syntax
- Describe how server-side code is executed on a Razor web page
  - The html and Razor code in a .cshtml page represents what is "executed" during the "render" phase of serving a page; therefore, all the server-side code actually has a "context" in which it runs.
