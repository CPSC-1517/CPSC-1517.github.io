# Razor Introduction

At the end of this topic, you should be able to:

* Describe what is meant by "Razor Syntax"
* List the server-side programming languages supported by Razor syntax and their common file extensions
* Create a bare-bones Razor Website
* Describe the term "context switching" as it applies to Razor syntax
* Explain how Razor syntax supports "context switching" in the server-side processing of a web page
* Distinguish between server-side code and HTML code in a Razor web form
* Describe what is meant by a "code block" in Razor syntax
* Describe how server-side code is executed on a Razor web page
  - The html and Razor code in a .cshtml page represents what is "executed" during the "render" phase of serving a page; therefore, all the server-side code actually has a "context" in which it runs.
