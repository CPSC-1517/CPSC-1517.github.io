        <p>Create a stored procedure called OverActiveMembers that takes a single number: ClubCount. This procedure should return the names of all members that are active in as many or more clubs than the supplied club count.
--    (p.s. - You might want to make sure to add more members to more clubs, seeing as tests for the last question might remove a lot of club members....)</p>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Add a stored procedure called ExpelStudent that takes a StudentID and performs the following actions:
            <ul>
                <li>Withdraw the student from every course that he/she does not have a mark in and set the mark for the course(s) to a zero. (There should be at least one course they are removed from, otherwise it should be considered an error.)</li>
                <li>Remove the student from all clubs in which they are active.</li>
            </ul>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Create a stored procedure called RegisterStudent that accepts StudentID, CourseID and Semester as parameters.
        If the number of students in that course and semester are not greater than the Max Students for that course,
        add a record to the Grade table and add the cost of the course to the students balance.
        If the registration would cause the course in that semester to have greater than MaxStudents for that course raise an error.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Add a stored procedure called WitnessProtection that erases all existence of a student from the database.
        The stored procedure takes the StudentID, first and last names, gender, and birthdate as parameters.
        Ensure that the student exists in the database before removing them (all the parameter values must match).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Create a procedure called StudentPayment that accepts Student ID and paymentamount as parameters. 
        Add the payment to the payment table and adjust the students balance owing to reflect the payment.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Create a stored procedure called WithdrawStudent that accepts a StudentID, CourseId, and semester as parameters. 
        Withdraw the student by updating their Withdrawn value to 'Y' and subtract 1/2 of the cost of the course from their balance. If the result would be a negative balance set it to 0.</p>
